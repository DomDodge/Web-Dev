        <h1>Game Development</h1>
        <div id="lefter">
            <p>Over the last several years I have had the opportunity to 
                grow my skills in Computer Science by working on video games with 
                team mates. I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects under 
                banner of Plasma Studios, and recently I have even released to publlish two games 
                professionally.
                <br>
                Throughout this journey I have learned valuable skills including: promblem-solving,
                team work, hitting dead-lines, and more!
